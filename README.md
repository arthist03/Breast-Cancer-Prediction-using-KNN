# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project, "Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning," employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict breast cancer. The dataset used for training and testing the model can be accessed on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nancyalaswad90/breast-cancer-dataset?select=data.csv), with the uploaded files `datasets_Breast Cancer.csv` and `KNN with breast cancer data.ipynb` containing the dataset and the main code file, respectively.

## Project Structure

- **datasets_Breast Cancer.csv**: This CSV file contains the breast cancer dataset.
- **KNN with breast cancer data.ipynb**: The main code file in Jupyter Notebook format.

## Model Used

The predictive power of this project is driven by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a versatile machine learning model.

## Applications

- **Early Detection**: The model aids in early detection of breast cancer, enabling timely intervention and treatment.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Predictive modeling contributes to personalized treatment plans based on individual patient characteristics.
- **Decision Support Tool**: The model serves as a decision support tool for healthcare professionals in the diagnostic process.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arthist03/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-KNN.git
   cd Breast-Cancer-Prediction-using-KNN

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project root directory as datasets_Breast Cancer.csv
  
4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook file:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "KNN with breast cancer data.ipynb" 
   ```
